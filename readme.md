## 1) Goal of the app:
# Developing an application that assesses your conscious moods during the day to analyze trends. We often think about our days/lives based on 1 feeling/thought instead of everything during the day. 
# Learning to use Android Studio, GitHub, and Java myself. This is my first project that I hope to finish.

## 2) Overview of functionality:
# Create welcome activity. Peaceful welcome screen with a visual & animation for a few seconds.
# Overview graph of past inputs.
# Notifications to quickly grade 3 things: peace of mind, living in the present moment, spending time usefully. Select activity that corresponds with these moods. 
# Grade spectrum: smileys. Very bad to neutral to great. Customize this spectrum. 

## 3) Current tasks:
# Design
1) Create welcome screen
2) 
# Functionality
